# AiFORTeca 0.2 — MASTER / Agent Control Center

## Release identity
- Android `versionName`: `0.2`
- Android `versionCode`: `3`
- Base commit: `9d91a3cdf4ea650f5027a175867fac01d1b95f1e` (AiFORTeca 0.0.2)
- Work branch: `work/aiforteca-0.2-master-agent-foundation`
- The 0.0.2 baseline remains unchanged and recoverable.

## Product priority
AiFORTeca is a MASTER-led agent orchestration workspace. The primary product surface is the coordination of MASTER, agents, tasks and shared memory. Provider/model administration is infrastructure for that system, not the home screen.

## 0.2 implementation scope
1. Open the app on the MASTER control center instead of the legacy chat screen.
2. Replace the legacy top-level tab row with department navigation:
   - MASTER
   - Zespół
   - Zadania
   - Pamięć
   - Komunikacja
   - Dostawcy
   - Diagnostyka
   - Czat
3. Preserve existing screens and local stores; navigation is reorganized, not destructive migration.
4. Add a task center that reads the existing durable MASTER work journal and task checkpoint journal.
5. Migrate only the known emulator-only default Ollama URL `http://10.0.2.2:11434/v1` to an empty, disabled endpoint on startup. Preserve model selection and every user-entered non-default endpoint. The user must enter their PC's actual private-LAN IPv4 address and explicitly opt into HTTP before a phone can connect.

## Existing foundations to reuse
- `TeamRunEngine`, `AgentCatalog`, `AgentManagerStore`: agent execution and management.
- `AgentProviderAssignmentStore`: durable role-to-provider assignments.
- `MasterWorkJournalStore`: bounded durable MASTER plans and progress.
- `TaskCheckpointStore`: task lifecycle and recovery journal.
- `AiMemoryStore`, `AgentOperationalMemoryStore`, `QualityLearningStore`: approved shared and agent-scoped learning.
- `ProviderClient`, `ProviderEndpointPolicy`, `SecureStore`: provider connectivity, endpoint validation and encrypted credentials.

## Non-destructive rules
- Do not delete or reset provider profiles, encrypted keys, chats, task journals, memories, quality history or agent definitions during UI work.
- Do not silently enable an agent or change its model assignment.
- Do not auto-resume interrupted work; keep the existing explicit recovery rules.
- Do not expose API keys or prompts in dashboards or logs.
- Do not treat a UI build as proof of working multi-agent execution.

## Acceptance gates before APK handoff
- Gradle wrapper validation.
- Full `testDebugUnitTest` suite.
- `assembleDebug`.
- Inspect APK metadata: package ID, versionName 0.2, versionCode 3.
- Inspect uploaded test reports and APK artifact.
- Manual device checks: launch to MASTER center; navigate all departments; verify task/memory screens read existing data; verify legacy emulator URL no longer triggers a network request; confirm user-configured LAN Ollama works only after explicit opt-in.
- Clearly distinguish automated tests from tests that require the user's physical phone and PC.

## Current checkpoint
Initial 0.2 source changes are committed on the work branch. CI/build status must be checked before any APK is called testable. No claim is made that physical-device Ollama connectivity or end-to-end agent orchestration has been manually verified.
